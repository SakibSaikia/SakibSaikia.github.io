Welcome to by blog. I set out to write this blog to collate my thoughts on important topics related to rendering, C++, GPU's etc. and to share my experiences on things that I worked on that I think are worth sharing/discussing. This will also help me recollect relevant details when I come back to it later.

Thanks for visiting.

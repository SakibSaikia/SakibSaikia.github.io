This is a short exercise on integration. We will derive the Lambertian BRDF from first principles to understand the origin of $$\pi$$ in it.

We start by stating that the Lambertian BRDF is $$\frac{\rho}{\pi}$$, where $$\rho$$ (albedo) is the measure of diffuse reflection. It is the proportion of incident light that is reflected from a surface and is used to denote how _bright_ a surface is (not to be confused with how _reflective_ a surface is). Albedo maps are used ubiquitously in lighting, and look like this.

However, we need to come up with a more formal mathematical definition in this case. Real Time Rendering 4th Edition defines albedo as the __hemispherical-directional reflectance__ which measures the _amount of light reflected along a given direction for incoming light in any direction in the hemisphere around the surface normal_. It can be represented as: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\rho = \int_{\Omega}f_r(x,\omega_i,\omega_o)  (\omega_i . n) d\omega_i
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
$$

where,

$$f_r$$ = BRDF at point $$x$$ for incoming radiance along $$\omega_i$$ and outgoing radiance along $$\omega_o$$  
$$(\omega_i . n)$$ = Weakening factor for incoming direction $$\omega_i$$ and normal $$n$$  
$${\Omega}$$ = This is used to denote the integration over the unit hemisphere

_Note: If this looks familiar to the [rendering equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation/), it is because it is. Albedo corresponds reflected radiance from a perfectly diffuse surface when lit uniformly by light of unit radiance._

Since the Lambertian BRDF is a model of diffuse reflectance it is invariant to the the viewing direction. In other words, it is constant and can be taken out of the itegral. 

$$
\rho = f_{lambert} \int_{\Omega}(\omega_i . n) d\omega_i
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow f_{lambert} = \frac{\rho}{\int_{\Omega}(\omega_i . n) d\omega_i}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
$$

Now, let's look at how to compute the integral $$\int_{\Omega}(\omega_i . n) d\omega_i$$. But, first let's do a quick refresher on integral calculus.

### Review

Informally, integration is the process by which we divide a region into *tiny parts* and then sum all those parts for the entire region to evaluate the property we are interested in such as area or volume.

<p align="center">

</p>

So, let's start with computing the area of a rectangle using integration. Here, we define a rectangle in Catesian coordinates. We identify a small patch with length $$dx$$ and height $$dy$$. The area of this patch is $$dx.dy$$. Since there are 2 variables, we need to compute a double integral for the range of $$x$$ and $$y$$ respectively.

$$
RectangleArea = \int_{x=2}^6\int_{y=1}^4dxdy = \int_{x=2}^6dx\int_{y=1}^4dy = \Big[x\Big]_{x=2}^6 \Big[y\Big]_{y=1}^4 = (6-2)(4-1) = 12
$$

This checks out since the area of the rectangle for length 4 and height 3 is 12.

Next up, let's try to compute the area of a circle of radius $$R$$ below.

We similarly isolate a small pathch for integration. The length of the patch is a tiny segment along the radius $$dr$$. Computing the arc length of the patch is sligtly tricky. We need to somehow find a way to represent it in terms of the angle $$d\theta$$ represented in radians. Fortunately for us, there is a direct relationship between radians and the length of the arc that subtends that angle. [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian)]

<p align="center">

</p>

So, the length of the arc is $$rd\theta$$. But what is the area of the patch? Turns out we can straighten the arc into a straight line, thereby converting our curved patch into a rectangle. This is known as [rectification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length). 

<p align="center">

</p>


With that out of the way, the area of the patch can be simply represented by $$dr.rd\theta$$. Now, let's find the area of the circle via integration.

$$
CircleArea = \int_{r=0}^R\int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi}rd\theta dr = \int_{r=0}^Rrdr\int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi}d\theta = \Big[\frac{r^2}{2}\Big]_{r=0}^R \Big[\theta\Big]_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} = \Big(\frac{R^2}{2}\Big)(2\pi) = \pi R^2 \checkmark
$$


### Hemisphere Integration

With that out of the way, let's get back to solving equation $$(2)$$. Here, we have to compute an itegral over the hemisphere. 

$$
\int_{\Omega}(\omega_i . n) d\omega_i
$$

Like earlier, we have to identify a small patch that we can integrate on. For that we resort to spherical coordinates. 

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/lambertian-brdf/spherical-coordinates.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

Here,   
$$\phi$$ is known as the *azimuth angle* and its range is from $$0$$ to $$2\pi$$.   
$$\theta$$ is known as the *elevation angle* and its range is from $$0$$ to $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$.

The following diagram shows us how such a patch can be constructed. The $$rd\theta$$ term is same as earlier since it lies on the [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle) or meridian. The radius of other circle is smaller -- $$rsin\theta$$. Hence, the length of that arc is $$rsin\theta d\theta$$ as shown below.

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/lambertian-brdf/hemisphere-integration.jpg">
</p>

Since the direction vector $$\omega_i$$ and normal $$n$$ are assumed to be unit length, and the weakening factor is invariant to the azimuth angle, we can rewrite $$\int_{\Omega}(\omega_i . n) d\omega_i$$ as

$$
\int_{\Omega}cos\theta d\omega_i
= \int_{\theta=0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}cos\theta.rd\theta.rsin\theta d\phi
=r^2 \int_{\theta=0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} sin\theta cos\theta d\theta \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}d\phi
$$

Using [trigonometric identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Multiple-angle_formulae) $$sin(2\theta) = 2sin \theta cos \theta$$, and substituting $$r=1$$ for unit hemisphere, we can rewrite this as

$$
\int_{\theta=0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{sin2\theta}{2} d\theta \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}d\phi
$$

Substituting, $$\Theta = 2 \theta$$ such that $$\frac{d \Theta}{d \theta} = 2$$, we can again rewrite this as

$$
\int_{\Theta=0}^{\pi} \frac{sin\Theta}{2} \frac{d\Theta}{2} \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}d\phi
= \frac{1}{4}\Big[-cos\Theta \Big]_{\Theta=0}^{\pi}\Big[\phi \Big]_0^{2\pi}
= \frac{1}{4}\times2\times2\pi
$$

Thus,

$$
\int_{\Omega}cos\theta d\omega_i = \pi
$$

and from equation $$(2)$$, we have

$$
f_{lambert} = \frac{albedo}{\pi}
$$

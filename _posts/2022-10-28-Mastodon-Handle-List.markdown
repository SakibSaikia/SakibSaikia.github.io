Twitter has always been a great place to mingle and share ideas for me. Graphics and gamedev twitter has built a community there that is irreplaceable. However ...

Lately, there is a lot of chatter and interest in finding an alternate space -- and a lot of people are turning to Mastodon. [@aras_p created a Mastodon instance back in 2017!](https://aras-p.info/blog/2017/12/04/Gamedev-Mastodon-mastodon.gamedev.place/). I've had an account there since 2018 but haven't used it at all. The problem? Waiting for a critical mass to move before making a switch -- a chicken-or-egg issue. In addition, you have to rediscover the community in the new space and make those connections again.

So, I'm maintaining a list of Twitter handles and their corresponding Mastodon handle, and will continue adding to it. Let's see where this goes..

```
* @aras_p --> @aras@mastodon.gamedev.place
* @doppioslash --> @doppioslash@mastodon.gamedev.place
* @jeriellsworth --> @JeriEllsworth@mastodon.social
* @sakibsaikia --> @thisarray@mastodon.gamedev.place
* @sparsevoxel --> @sparsevoxel@mastodon.gamedev.place
* @tom_forsyth --> @TomF@mastodon.gamedev.place
```
